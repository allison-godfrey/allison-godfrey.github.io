<!-- ### My Path to Data Science -->

I have a longstanding passion for working towards educational equity. Specifically, I want to be in the fight towards breaking down the economic, technological and health barriers that stand between students and quality learning. I believe that a bias-informed application of data science can work to break down these barriers and help make quality education a right, not a privilege.

### Experience

##### Business Intelligence Data Analyst Intern, **Healthline Media**
I owned the data pipeline for the Digital Performance Marketing team's cost analysis needs. This involved getting marketing spend data from 5 different media sites ingested and QA'd in BigQuery, aggregating and manipulating tables to be pulled into Tableau, creating dashboards that visualize the data in a way that meets the reporting needs, and finally iterating on those dashboards through communication with the DPM team. I worked with the forecasting team on translating the traffic forecasting model in Excel to a Tableau dashboard for ease of use and more informative visualizations.  I worked with the content updates team to create 4 different dashboards analyzing metrics pre and post article updates to help determine the effect that the update may have had on article traffic. I did a high level analysis of average scroll rate, average bounce rate, and average session duration aggregated on the page path level and presented this analysis to my team. Lastly, I was responsible for many ad-hoc requests, from one-time data pulls to creating quick views in Data Studio or Tableau to fill immediate needs. 

##### Corps Member, **Teach for America**
I served as the 8th grade math teacher for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years and as the math content team lead for the 2018-19 school year at Alliance Academy, a Title I district public school in East Oakland, CA. I always strived to put inquiry and student voice at the forefront of my teaching practice in order to create an equitable and brave space for students to fully engage in the mathematical learning process. As the math team lead, I was responsible for leading weekly team meetings where we developed data-centered practices for instructional intervention and worked towards data transparancy in every math classroom. During the 2018-19 school year, the math team experienced the highest growth in the school's history and 8th grade math experienced the highest growth in the district as measured by standardized test scores. 

##### Data Analyst Intern, **McKesson Corporation**
As a data analyst intern, I was responsible for creating various Tableau dashboards to visualize factors contributing to lost profit throughout the company. I then presented these dashboards to both technical and non technical audiences. In addition, I cleaned, organized, and filtered large data sets to then be used in Tableau.
