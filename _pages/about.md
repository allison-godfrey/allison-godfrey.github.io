<!-- ### My Path to Data Science -->

I have a longstanding passion for working towards educational equity. Specifcally, I want to be in the fight towards breaking down the economic, technological and health barriers that stand between students and quality learning. I believe that a bias-informed application of Data Science can work to break down these barriers and help make quality education a right, not a privilege.
