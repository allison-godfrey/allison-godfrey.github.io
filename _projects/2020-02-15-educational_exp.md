<!-- ## About the Project -->

#### Project Description 
A data analysis and visualization project analyzing whether a state's political leaning affects the level of education expenditure and achievement of that state (2000-2015). 

See the following <a href= "https://github.com/allison-godfrey/education_expenditures/blob/master/us_education_project.ipynb">Notebook</a> which contains all the EDA and Data Cleaning. See the <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~allisongodfrey/ed_expenditures/">Visualization Dashboard</a> here. 

This project uses this Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project#states_all_extended.csv">Data Set</a> containing state-level expenditures and student score data. Due to missing data, I chose to analyze only 2000-2015, though the data set goes father back. 


#### Skills 
Data Visualization, Data Cleansing, Correlation Analysis, Web Design

#### Tools 
Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, Python/Pandas, Matplotlib, HTML, Jave Script

#### Motivation 
There are many factors that affect educational attainment, quality, and equity. One prominant factor is the level of educational spending at the given school or area. The educational system has been underfunded for years, leaving teachers and students to find charitable donations to fund their schools and classrooms. I am a former teacher in a Title 1 school and participated in the 2019 Oakland Teacher Strike fighting primarily for higher teacher salaries, lower student-to-teacher ratios, and more nurses per school site. Everything we fought for comes down to funding and educational expenditures from the local, state, and federal levels. 

Of course, educational spending is a multifaceted issue with a complex history. This specific project is studying one of the possible underlying reasons for differences in educational expenditure: political leaning. 

#### Results
